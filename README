Using autotest
--------------

1. bundle install to get all gems testing framework gems installed
2. install autotest separately as it contains some platform specific stuff and the app doesn't need it to run.
   Instructions are taken from here, which contains instructions for other platforms: 
   http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:autotest

    gem install autotest
    gem install autotest-rails-pure

    on OSX only (assumes growl notifications are installed already):
    gem install autotest-fsevent
    gem install autotest-growl

2. start spork server: bundle exec spork
3. start autotest: bundle exec autotest

Rspec knows to use spork by default because of --drb in the .rspec file.

Now when you save a source file or a test file, autotest will auto rerun all tests and notify.
Spork speeds things up by not reloading configuration, so if you make a change to config and the tests
don't seem to pay attention to the config change, restart the spork server.
