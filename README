This is the new Reposiory using MongoDB.

These are instructions for a setup that automatically runs tests when you save source or spec files. VERY VERY useful for TDD.

Using autotest (running ruby rspec tests automatically when ruby source or ruby rspec files change on the file system)
--------------

1. bundle install to get all gems testing framework gems installed. Some of the gems are OSX specific
   (in the Gemfile they are under if plaform = OSX. Instructions are taken from here, which contains instructions for other platforms: 
   http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:autotest)

2. start spork server: 

   bundle exec spork

3. start autotest: 

   bundle exec autotest

Rspec knows to use spork by default because of --drb in the .rspec file.

Now when you save a source file or a test file, autotest will auto rerun all tests and notify.
Spork speeds things up by not reloading configuration, so if you make a change to config and the tests
don't seem to pay attention to the config change, restart the spork server.

Similar setup for jasmine (auto running jasmine JS tests in the same way)
-------------------------

1. qt must be installed (v4.7.X). On OSX with homebrew:

    cd /usr/local
    git checkout 83f742e -- Library/Formula/qt.rb   (This sets the qt version to 4.7.4, the default is 4.8.0)

2. If you want nice notifications you need growl v1.3.X from the app store (I had a lower version installed free from photoshop install)
2. bundle install to install guard, jasmine-headless-webkit and guard-jasmine-headless-webkit (and ruby_gntp for growl notifications)
3. The relevant guardfile and .jasmine-headless-webkit files should already be in the repo
4. bundle exec guard to run guard to monitor the files, and run specs as required
